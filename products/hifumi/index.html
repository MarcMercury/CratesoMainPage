                <p>
                    The birthplace of all life and philosophy. Here, the three great laws of life 
                    were established: <strong>Hi</strong> (Peace), <strong>Fu</strong> (Generosity), 
                    and <strong>Mi</strong> (Kindness). For millennia, the people lived in accordance 
                    with these principles.

                <h3>The Philosopher's Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    200 years ago, a young philosopher from Eden saw a plume of smoke from a distant, 
                    unvisited island. Overcome with curiosity, he set sail alone to share the three 
                    great laws of life with those unknown people.

                <h3>Birth of the Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon arrival, he found a war-torn island devastated by conflict. Seeking a 
                    peaceful resolution, he helped devise a simple game—one that would replace 
                    war and fighting with a structured system of resolution. This was the birth 
                    of Hi Fu Mi.
