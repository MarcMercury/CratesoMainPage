            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>What is CLO?</h3>
            <p>CLO (Chief Life Officer) is a unified life management platform that helps you organize three core areas: your Self (personal wellness and tasks), your Relationships (connection with important people), and your Home (household management).</p>
            
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. CLO is built on a "Local-First" philosophy with bank-grade encryption. We never sell your data, show you ads, or share your information with third parties.</p>
            
            <h3>How does the Vault work?</h3>
            <p>The Vault is a double-locked storage feature in the Relationships module. Both you and your partner must agree to access Vault contents—neither party can access it alone.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can export all your data at any time in standard formats. Your data belongs to you.</p>
            
            <h3>What platforms is CLO available on?</h3>
            <p>CLO is coming soon to iOS and Android. Join our waitlist to be notified when we launch.</p>
