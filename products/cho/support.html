                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>How do I add a new product to my inventory?</h3>
                <p>Open the CHO app, tap the "+" button, and either scan the product barcode or manually enter the details. CHO will automatically fetch available product information, manuals, and warranty details.</p>
                
                <h3>How does subscription detection work?</h3>
                <p>With your permission, CHO connects to your bank account (read-only) to identify recurring charges. You can review detected subscriptions and take action directly from the app.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I share my household with my partner?</h3>
                <p>Yes! CHO supports household sharing. Invite your partner via email, and they'll have full access to the shared household dashboard. Both users can add, edit, and manage household items.</p>
                
                <h3>What happens to my data if I cancel?</h3>
                <p>You can export all your household data at any time. If you delete your account, all data is permanently removed within 30 days. See our <a href="data-deletion.html">Data Deletion</a> page for details.</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                <h3>Barcode not scanning?</h3>
                <p>Ensure good lighting and hold the camera steady. If a barcode isn't in our database, you can manually enter the product details.</p>
                
                <h3>Connected service not syncing?</h3>
                <p>Try disconnecting and reconnecting the service in Settings. If issues persist, contact support with the error message.</p>
